# JayBot

Simple Discord bot made for a friend of mine.
Updates certain Discord channels with text reposts of Reddit links.
Probably will update simple text files and extensibility later with SQLite or something.

## Installation:
- Python 3
- requirements.txt (has all Python modules)

## Configuration: 
- rename `example.config.yaml` to `config.yaml`
